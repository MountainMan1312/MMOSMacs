# Contributing to MMOSMacs

Howdy, and welcome to the MMOSMacs git repository. This document
outlines the conventions and standards for the project.


## This is personal

Please understand that this is my personal Emacs configuration. MMOSMacs
is designed to meet my personal needs. I welcome any and all
contributions, and I will do my best to make MMOSMacs accessible to
others, but my needs and preferences ultimately take priority.

All contributors are listed at the end of this document. If you have
contributed and your name does not appear here, submit a PR or RFC Issue
for it to be added.


## Code of Conduct

I will reject all contributions from:
- people who abuse other contributors.
- people I know to be affiliated with any state agency.

Furthermore, individual items will be rejected because of:
- exceptionally vulgar language.
- ignorance or disregard of the `STYLE_GUIDE.md` or Issue/PR templates.


## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute.

The easiest way you can contribute is by taking part in the discussions
on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/MountainMan1312/MMOSMacs/Issues).
You can comment on topics that already have an existing Issue, or you
can submit your own if it does not already exist. Issues can take the
form of:
- **Feedback**: share your thoughts about MMOSMacs.
- **Bug Report**: discusion about a problem with the MMOSMacs code.
- **RFC**: discussion about making a change to MMOSMacs.

Before submitting a new issue, search for existing duplicate issues. If
it already exists, comment on the existing Issue instead of making a new
one. Duplicate issues will be removed and you will be asked to move your
post to the comment section of the existing post. It's not to be rude,
it's just for organization's sake.

Each type of Issue has an Issue Template. The templates can be found in
the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory. Pull reqeusts also have
templates which are located in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`.

To contribute code:
1. Make an RFC or find an existing one
2. Discuss your proposed changes
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a Pull Request
