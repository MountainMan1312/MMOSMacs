# MMOSMacs

MMOSMacs is the Emacs configuration for MMOS, which is currently just an
idea I have for an Emacs-centric Linux distribution. MMOSMacs is the
core of my computing experience, and is designed to be a
jack-of-all-trades just like me.

MMOSMacs is currently in the planning phase.


## Plans

- Modular non-literate configuration
- `straight.el` + `use-package` package management
- Emacs as a desktop environment (`EXWM`, `EDNC`)
- System & network administration suite
- Security & crytography
- Software development environment
- Communications (Email, RSS, IRC, Matrix, etc.)
- Opinionated PKMS and publishing suite
- Common desktop applications
    - Web browser, FTP, Torrent
    - Multimedia production
    - OpenSCAD / ImplicitCAD
    - Finance
    - Games
- Custom modeline & anti-distraction features
- Custom theme deisnged to reduce eye-strain
- Custom keybinds, menus, & dialogs

This is my personal project. I will do what I can to make it accessible
to other people, but ultimately it is crafted to suit my own needs.
